# D3 Implementation Plan Template

## Purpose
Generate implementation plan for a feature based on its spec.md. Maps user stories to technical tasks, entities, and endpoints.

## Input Required
- spec.md
- Optional: research.md, data-model.md

## Phase 1: Setup
- [ ] Environment setup
- [ ] Dependency installation
- [ ] Initial project structure
- [ ] Configuration files
- [ ] Basic tests framework

## Phase 2: Foundational infrastructure
- [ ] Database setup/models
- [ ] Authentication/authorization (if needed)
- [ ] Core utilities/helpers
- [ ] Error handling framework
- [ ] Logging setup

## Phase 3+: User Story implementation plans
### User Story 1
- [ ] Entity/Model definition
- [ ] Service layer implementation
- [ ] Controller/API endpoint
- [ ] UI Component (if applicable)
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests (if applicable)

### User Story 2
- [ ] Entity/Model definition
- [ ] Service layer implementation
- [ ] Controller/API endpoint
- [ ] UI Component (if applicable)
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Integration tests (if applicable)

*[Continue for all user stories]*

## Phase N: Parallel exploration (optional)
- [P] Opportunity 1: [Description of parallelizable work]
- [P] Opportunity 2: [Description of parallelizable work]
- [P] Opportunity 3: [Description of parallelizable work]

## Phase N+1: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
- [ ] User experience refinements
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Documentation updates
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Security review

## Dependencies & Execution Order
- [ ] Identify dependencies between user stories/components
- [ ] Define critical path for sequential development
- [ ] Highlight components that can be developed independently
- [ ] Estimate effort for each phase/story

## Developer Intent Tracking
- [ ] Map each implementation task back to original developer intent
- [ ] Ensure each user story delivers on the intended value
- [ ] Track how implementation decisions align with original goals
