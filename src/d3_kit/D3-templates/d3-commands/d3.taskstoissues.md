# Convert D3 Tasks to GitHub Issues

**Purpose**: This command converts D3 task lists into GitHub issues for project management and tracking.

## Instructions

When you run `/d3.taskstoissues`, I will:

1. **Parse your tasks.md file** - Extract all user stories and tasks from your d3-features/[feature-name]/tasks.md
2. **Create GitHub issues** - Convert each major user story into a GitHub issue with appropriate labels
3. **Organize by priority** - Use [P] markers to determine priority and parallelization opportunities
4. **Link related tasks** - Create issue dependencies based on task relationships

## Format

I will create issues with:
- Title: User story summary
- Description: Full user story details with acceptance criteria
- Labels: 
  - `feature/[feature-name]` - Feature grouping
  - `P1`, `P2`, `P3` - Priority based on importance
  - `parallelizable` - If marked with [P] in your tasks
  - `blocked` - If task depends on others
- Assignee: Based on team assignment if specified

## Requirements

Before running `/d3.taskstoissues`, ensure:
- You have specified GitHub repository details
- You have appropriate permissions to create issues
- Your tasks.md file is complete and well-formatted
- All dependencies between tasks are clearly documented
