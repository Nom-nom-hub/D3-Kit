## Outline

The `/d3.implement` command executes all tasks from `d3-features/[current-branch]/tasks.md` to build the feature according to the plan. This is the final step in the D3 workflow that generates actual code from the structured tasks.

Given the current feature directory, do this:

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR, TASKS_FILE, and IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.

2. **Validate prerequisites**: Confirm ALL required files exist before starting implementation:
   - `spec.md`: Feature specification with coding slices
   - `plan.md`: Technical implementation plan  
   - `tasks.md`: Actionable task list
   - No unresolved [CLARIFY] markers in spec or plan

3. **Load and parse tasks**: Read `tasks.md` and organize tasks by execution order:
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (must complete first)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites)
   - Phase 3+: Tasks organized by coding slice (P1, P2, P3...)
   - Phase N: Parallel exploration tasks (if present)
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns

4. **Execute tasks in dependency order**:
   - Execute Phase 1 (Setup) tasks first
   - Execute Phase 2 (Foundational) tasks after setup completes
   - For each coding slice phase, execute tasks respecting dependencies
   - Execute parallelizable tasks [P] simultaneously when possible
   - Execute slice-specific tasks [SL1], [SL2], etc. within their respective phases
   - Execute parallel exploration tasks [PEX] in parallel when appropriate
   - Execute final phase tasks after all slice work completes

5. **Monitor and validate execution**:
   - Track progress of each task (completed, failed, blocked)
   - For failed tasks, attempt to identify root cause and suggest fixes
   - Maintain independence of coding slices - ensure failure in one doesn't block others unnecessarily
   - Log all implementation activities for traceability

6. **Verify implementation against specification**:
   - Confirm all functionality described in spec.md has been implemented
   - Verify that developer intent from each coding slice is fulfilled
   - Check that success criteria from spec.md are met by the implementation
   - Validate that all acceptance scenarios can be demonstrated

7. **Report completion**: Output summary of implementation status:
   - Number of tasks completed successfully
   - Number of tasks that failed or were blocked
   - Verification against original specification and developer intent
   - Next steps for validation or deployment

## D3-Kit Implementation Principles

- **Intent Fidelity**: Ensure all code implements the original developer intent captured in the spec
- **Slice Independence**: Each coding slice should be implemented and testable independently
- **Parallel Execution**: Maximize parallel execution opportunities marked with [P] in tasks
- **Traceability**: All code should be traceable back to specific coding slices and original intent
- **Quality Assurance**: Implementation should meet quality standards defined in the constitution

## Key Guidelines

- Respect task dependencies and execution order
- Execute parallel tasks [P] simultaneously when system resources allow
- Maintain independence between coding slices [SL1], [SL2], etc.
- Verify implementation aligns with original developer intent
- Ensure all generated code is testable and maintainable
