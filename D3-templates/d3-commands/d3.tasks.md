# /d3.tasks - Generate Executable Tasks

## CRITICAL: Execute Script First

Execute the script to generate the tasks file from the plan.

### Step 1: Execute the Script

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/bash/d3-tasks.sh "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
. scripts/powershell/d3-tasks.ps1 "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

### Step 2: Parse JSON Response

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "Executable tasks generated successfully",
  "data": {
    "feature_dir": "d3-features/001-feature-name",
    "feature_name": "feature-name",
    "tasks_file": "d3-features/001-feature-name/tasks.md"
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Confirm to User

```
✓ Created tasks.md for feature: 001-feature-name
  Location: d3-features/001-feature-name/tasks.md
```

## What the Script Does

1. Validates that plan.md exists
2. Loads the tasks template
3. Creates `tasks.md` file
4. Returns file path

## Requirements

- Must have run `/d3.plan` first
- Feature directory must exist

## Next Steps

- Edit tasks.md to add specific implementation tasks
- Run `/d3.checklist` to create quality validation checklists
- Run `/d3.implement` to initialize the implementation workflow
