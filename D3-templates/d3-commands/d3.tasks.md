## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse D3_FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from D3_FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (coding slices with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute D3 task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract coding slices with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) - now called slices instead of user stories
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to coding slices
   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to coding slices
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks and parallel exploration opportunities
   - Generate tasks organized by coding slice (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing slice completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per slice
   - Identify opportunities for parallel exploration of multiple approaches
   - Validate task completeness (each coding slice has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `d3-templates/d3-tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all coding slices)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per coding slice (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: slice goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Phase N: Parallel exploration (if requested based on research.md)
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing slice completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per slice
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per coding slice
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each slice
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just Slice 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: {ARGS}

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by coding slice to enable independent implementation and testing.
**D3-KIT FOCUS**: Emphasize slices (AI-codable units) over user stories for better AI task generation.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Slice?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Slice] label**: REQUIRED for coding slice phase tasks only
   - Format: [SL1], [SL2], [SL3], etc. (maps to coding slices from spec.md, not user stories)
   - Setup phase: NO slice label
   - Foundational phase: NO slice label
   - Coding Slice phases: MUST have slice label
   - Parallel exploration: PEX label
   - Polish phase: NO slice label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [SL1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [SL1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] TXXX [PEX] Explore performance optimization in approach-a/src/`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Slice label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [SL1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [SL1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [SL1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From Coding Slices (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each coding slice (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their slice:
     - Models needed for that slice
     - Services needed for that slice
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that slice
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that slice
   - Mark slice dependencies (most slices should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the coding slice it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that slice's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the coding slice(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple slices: Put in earliest slice or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate slice phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Slice-specific setup → within that slice's phase

5. **From Parallel Exploration Opportunities**:
   - Multiple approaches for performance → Parallel Exploration phase (Phase N)
   - Multiple approaches for usability → Parallel Exploration phase (Phase N)
   - Compare and validate alternatives → Final phases

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before coding slices)
- **Phase 3+**: Coding Slices in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each slice: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Phase N**: Parallel Exploration (if research.md identified opportunities)
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns
