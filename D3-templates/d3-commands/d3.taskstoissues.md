# /d3.taskstoissues - Convert Tasks to GitHub Issues

## Execute the Script

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/bash/d3-taskstoissues.sh "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
. scripts/powershell/d3-taskstoissues.ps1 "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

## What This Does

1. Validates that tasks.md exists
2. Parses the tasks file
3. Creates `created-issues.md` tracking file
4. If GitHub CLI (`gh`) is available: Auto-creates issues with:
   - Feature labels
   - Priority tags
   - Parallelization markers ([P] tasks)
   - Blocked dependencies
5. If GitHub CLI not available: Generates commands for manual creation

## Output

Creates file: `d3-features/001-feature-name/created-issues.md`

Issue labels created:
- `feature/feature-name` - Groups issues by feature
- `task` - Marks as implementation task
- `priority-1`, `priority-2`, `priority-3` - Task priority
- `parallelizable` - Tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- `blocked` - Tasks with dependencies

## Prerequisites

- GitHub CLI installed (optional, but recommended):
  ```bash
  # macOS
  brew install gh
  
  # Windows
  choco install gh
  ```

## How to Use

1. Ensure tasks.md is complete and well-formatted
2. Run `/d3.taskstoissues` to create issues
3. If auto-creation worked: Issues are created in GitHub
4. If manual: Use the commands in created-issues.md to create issues
5. Track progress using GitHub project boards

## When to Run

- After tasks.md is finalized
- Before starting implementation
- To organize team work on GitHub
