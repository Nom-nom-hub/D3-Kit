# /d3.research - Gather Technical Research

## Execute the Script

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/bash/d3-research.sh "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
. scripts/powershell/d3-research.ps1 "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

## What This Does

1. Validates that spec.md exists
2. Creates `research.md` file
3. Provides structured areas for technical exploration:
   - Library/framework comparisons
   - Performance considerations
   - Security concerns
   - Integration patterns
   - Existing solutions analysis

## Output

Creates file: `d3-features/001-feature-name/research.md`

## How to Use

1. Run `/d3.research` to generate the template
2. Fill in findings for each research area
3. Document technology stack recommendations
4. List key dependencies
5. Identify risk factors
6. Use findings to inform `/d3.plan`

## When to Run

- After creating/clarifying the specification
- Before creating the implementation plan
- When evaluating technology choices
