# /d3.clarify - Resolve Specification Ambiguities

## Execute the Script

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/bash/d3-clarify.sh "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
. scripts/powershell/d3-clarify.ps1 "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

## What This Does

1. Analyzes the spec.md file
2. Counts unresolved [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
3. Returns JSON with clarification details
4. Guides you to edit the spec and resolve ambiguities

## After Running

1. Edit `d3-features/001-feature-name/spec.md`
2. Find all `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...]` markers
3. Replace them with actual decisions/answers
4. Save the file
5. Run `/d3.plan` when all clarifications are resolved

## Example Clarification Marker

In spec.md, you might find:
```
- [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should we support scientific functions or just basic arithmetic?]
```

Replace with:
```
- Support basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, ÷) only. Scientific functions are out of scope.
```
