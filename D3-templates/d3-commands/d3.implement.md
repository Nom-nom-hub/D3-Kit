# /d3.implement - Initialize Implementation

## Execute the Script

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/bash/d3-implement.sh "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
. scripts/powershell/d3-implement.ps1 "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

## What This Does

1. Validates that spec, plan, and tasks all exist
2. Creates `implementation-log.md` file
3. Provides structure for:
   - Implementation phases (Setup, Core, Integration, Testing, Deployment)
   - Task progress tracking
   - Issues encountered and resolutions
   - Blockers and dependencies
   - Performance metrics
   - Sign-off tracking

## Output

Creates file: `d3-features/001-feature-name/implementation-log.md`

## How to Use

1. Run `/d3.implement` to initialize the workflow
2. Follow the phases defined in implementation-log.md
3. Execute tasks from tasks.md
4. **CRITICAL: When editing existing files**:
   - Read the entire existing file first
   - Identify what to add or modify
   - Make targeted changes only (diffs)
   - Preserve all existing code
   - **NEVER regenerate entire files** (unless explicitly requested)
5. Track progress in the log
6. Document any issues encountered
7. Record performance metrics
8. Get sign-off when complete

## Prerequisites

Must have completed:
- `/d3.intend` - Feature specification
- `/d3.plan` - Implementation plan
- `/d3.tasks` - Task breakdown

## When to Run

- When ready to start actual development
- After all planning and design is complete
- Before developers begin coding
