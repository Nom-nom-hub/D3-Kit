# /d3.analyze - Cross-Artifact Analysis

## Execute the Script

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/bash/d3-analyze.sh "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
. scripts/powershell/d3-analyze.ps1 "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

## What This Does

1. Checks which artifacts exist (spec, plan, tasks)
2. Detects issues and missing dependencies
3. Counts unresolved clarifications
4. Reports whether the feature is ready for next phase

## JSON Response Example

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "artifacts_present": ["spec", "plan"],
    "issues": ["Missing tasks.md - Run /d3.tasks after plan"],
    "is_complete": false
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

- **After creating spec**: Check if ready to plan
- **After creating plan**: Check if ready to create tasks
- **Before implementation**: Ensure all artifacts exist and are consistent

## What Issues Mean

- "Missing spec.md" → Run `/d3.intend` first
- "Missing plan.md" → Run `/d3.plan` first
- "Missing tasks.md" → Run `/d3.tasks` first
- "X unresolved clarifications" → Run `/d3.clarify` to resolve them
