# /d3.data - Generate Data Models

## Execute the Script

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/bash/d3-data.sh "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
. scripts/powershell/d3-data.ps1 "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

## What This Does

1. Validates that spec.md exists
2. Creates `data-model.md` file
3. Provides structure for:
   - Key entities definition
   - Entity attributes and types
   - Relationships between entities
   - State diagrams
   - Storage strategy
   - Access patterns
   - Validation rules

## Output

Creates file: `d3-features/001-feature-name/data-model.md`

## How to Use

1. Run `/d3.data` to generate the template
2. Define all key entities (users, posts, transactions, etc.)
3. Specify attributes and data types
4. Draw relationships (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.)
5. Document how data flows through the system
6. Define validation constraints

## When to Run

- After specification is stable
- Before finalizing the implementation plan
- When designing the data persistence layer
