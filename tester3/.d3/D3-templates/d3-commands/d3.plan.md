## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `{SCRIPT}` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, D3_FEATURES_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `/memory/d3-constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute D3 plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "CLARIFY")
   - Fill D3-Kit Principles Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all CLARIFY)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate D3-Kit Principles Check post-design
   - Phase 2: Identify parallel exploration opportunities

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each CLARIFY → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   For parallel exploration opportunities:
     Task: "Identify multiple approaches for {component}: performance, usability, maintainability"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]
   - Parallel opportunities: [approaches that could be explored simultaneously]

**Output**: research.md with all CLARIFY resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `{AGENT_SCRIPT}`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

### Phase 2: Parallel Exploration Analysis

**Prerequisites:** All design artifacts complete

1. **Identify components suitable for parallel exploration**:
   - Performance optimization approaches
   - Usability variations
   - Maintainability strategies
   - Architecture alternatives for complex components

2. **Document parallelization strategy**:
   - Which components can be developed in parallel
   - Architectural patterns that support multiple implementations
   - Validation strategies for comparing approaches

**Output**: Parallelization strategy documented in plan and research.md

## D3-Kit Principles Focus

- **Intent-First Development**: Ensure all decisions serve original developer intent
- **Parallel Exploration**: Actively identify opportunities for multiple approaches
- **Executable Specifications**: Designs must generate working code
- **Continuous Validation**: Plans must include validation strategies
- **Task-Oriented Development**: Designs should support clear task breakdown
- **Test-First Thinking**: All plans must include testing strategies
- **No Speculation**: All decisions must map to user stories or requirements

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications
- Emphasize opportunities for parallel development and exploration
- Ensure all technical decisions serve the original developer intent
