## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How do I get started with D3-Kit?

A: Start with the [README.md](README.md) quick start guide. Initialize a project with `d3 init <project_name>`, then use the sequence: `/d3.intend`, `/d3.plan`, `/d3.tasks`, `/d3.implement`.

### Q: What's the difference between `/d3.intend` and `/d3.specify`?

A: Both create specifications. `/d3.intend` is the primary command focusing on developer intent, while `/d3.specify` is an alias for backward compatibility.

### Q: How do [P] markers work in tasks?

A: [P] markers indicate parallelization opportunities in your task lists, allowing AI agents to work on multiple tasks simultaneously when dependencies allow.
