# /d3.checklist - Generate Quality Checklists

## Execute the Script

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/bash/d3-checklist.sh "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
. scripts/powershell/d3-checklist.ps1 "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

## What This Does

1. Validates that spec.md exists
2. Creates `checklists/requirements.md` file
3. Generates a quality validation checklist with items to verify before proceeding

## Output Structure

Creates file: `d3-features/001-feature-name/checklists/requirements.md`

The checklist validates:
- Content quality (no implementation details, clear writing)
- Requirement completeness (testable, unambiguous)
- Feature readiness (acceptance criteria defined, edge cases covered)

## How to Use

1. Run `/d3.checklist` to generate the checklist
2. Go through each item in `requirements.md`
3. Check off items as they pass validation
4. If items fail, update the spec.md and re-generate
5. Proceed to next phase when all items pass

## When to Run

- After creating spec.md
- After updating spec with clarifications
- Before creating the implementation plan
