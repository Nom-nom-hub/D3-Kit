# /d3.data - Generate Data Models

## Execute the Script

**On Linux/Mac:**
```bash
bash scripts/bash/d3-data.sh "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

**On Windows:**
```powershell
. scripts/powershell/d3-data.ps1 "d3-features/001-feature-name"
```

## What This Does

1. Validates that spec.md exists
2. Creates `data-model.md` file
3. Provides structure for:
   - Key entities definition
   - Entity attributes and types
   - Relationships between entities
   - State diagrams
   - Storage strategy
   - Access patterns
   - Validation rules

## Output

Creates file: `d3-features/001-feature-name/data-model.md`

### Step 2: Parse JSON Response and Fill in Data Model

After the script creates data-model.md, open it and fill in:

1. **Key Entities**: Define all major entities (users, posts, items, etc.)
   - Entity name and description
   - What business purpose does it serve?

2. **Entity Attributes**:
   - Attribute name, data type, constraints
   - Which attributes are required vs optional?
   - Any validation rules?

3. **Relationships**:
   - How do entities relate (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)?
   - Foreign keys and referential integrity

4. **State Diagrams** (if applicable):
   - What states can entities be in?
   - What transitions are allowed?

5. **Storage Strategy**:
   - Should this be in a database, file system, cloud storage, etc.?
   - Any specific technology requirements?

6. **Access Patterns**:
   - How will this data be queried most frequently?
   - Performance considerations?

7. **Validation Rules**:
   - What constraints must be enforced?
   - Business rules about data validity?

## When to Run

- After specification is stable
- Before finalizing the implementation plan
- When designing the data persistence layer
